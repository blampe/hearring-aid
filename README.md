**Hear what your LiDAR is missing.**

This repo contains scripts for deploying and self-hosting a MusicBrainz instance in conjunction with L‚Äî‚Äî's metadata API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A hosted `api.musicinfo.pro` instance is provided as a service to the community. The software it's running is not my own, and I cannot guarantee its stability. If you'd like to help improve it, please reach out!

The process to use the provided `api.musicinfo.pro` instance varies depending on whether you're using Docker. Non-Docker users will need to update the SQLite database directly.

## üöÄ Docker Images

- The simplest way to use the hosted instance is by changing your L‚Äî‚Äî image to one of the [available tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/blampe/lidarr/tags).
  - This image is based on the upstream LinuxServer.io image, with a small nginx proxy that redirects metadata queries to `api.musicinfo.pro`.

- Alternatively, if you're already using L‚Äî‚Äî plugin builds (hot.io or LinuxServer.io), you can use the Tubifarry Plugin to set a custom metadata server.
  - [Section 10.1 of the self-hosted guide](https://github.com/blampe/hearring-aid/blob/main/docs/self-hosted-mirror-setup.md#101-configure-tubifarry-plugin-in-lidarr) provides detailed steps.
  - At step 8, set the metadata server URL to: `https://api.musicinfo.pro`

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual SQL (Non-Docker)

If you're not using Docker or don't want to use a forked image, you can override the default metadata server by inserting a row into your SQLite database:

```sql
INSERT INTO Config (Key, Value) VALUES ('metadatasource', 'https://api.musicinfo.pro/api/v0.4/');
```

To revert to the official metadata server:

```sql
DELETE FROM Config WHERE Key = 'metadatasource';
```

## üß± Self-Hosting

A step-by-step self-hosting guide is available using `docker-compose`. It walks through how to use the official [musicbrainz-docker](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-docker) stack along with the L‚Äî‚Äî Metadata API image.

> **tl;dr:** Vanilla MusicBrainz images work just fine with the open-source metadata server ‚Äî it's just a little tricky to configure.
